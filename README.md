Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition. It contains information about the passengers, such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived.

Training Data: train.csv
Test Data: test.csv

Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing includes filling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing numerical features.


python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
Model Training
Train the Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.


python scripts/model_training.py
Evaluation
Evaluate the model on the test data and generate predictions.


python scripts/model_evaluation.py
Model Training
The model training involves:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Creating a pipeline for data preprocessing.
Using Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.
Training the model on the training set.
Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on its accuracy on the test set. The predictions are saved to predictions/predictions.csv.

Results
The final predictions can be found in predictions/predictions.csv.
